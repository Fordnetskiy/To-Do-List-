Hello, this is my JS practice

Everything is simple, there is an input field and a button that sends the text from this input field to an empty list, which creates blocks with text, a delete button and marks of the completed task, at the bottom there is a block with a filter for completed and active tasks, and a button to delete everything in the list. I learned more about DOM in JS, functions, but I still limp in the local Storage, I had to ask for help in the chat gpt, but I'll study it anyway, oh and I forgot, there's also a dark theme switch
